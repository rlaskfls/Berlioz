        <a class="fun" href="https://www.berliozmusic.com">Berlioz</a> is a stage name for Jasper Edward Attlee, a jazz-house producer and multi-instrumentalist from Cape Town, 
        South Africa, currently based in the UK. He blends elements of jazz, house, and Afro-inspired rhythms in his music, 
        creating a unique sound described as "if Matisse made house music." His work features a mix of live instrumentation, 
        intricate sampling, and spontaneous creativity.
